## Courier Service notification

When a new courier arrives, the guard will add it to the portal, and it'll send an email to the student, and also appear in the portal. A few issues - if the courier is not addressed to a person, but say their room number, or a pseudonym, then it is not possible to send the notification.

## New feature for the courier portal

Allowing other students to collect on a student's behalf. The student can issue a ticket in the portal saying that another student with these details will pick up their courier for them. This can be done by adding a form to the portal page which allows a student to enter another student's details. It'll generate an OTP code for the student which they can share with the guard and collect the package. The other student can also revoke this OTP if they change their mind.
